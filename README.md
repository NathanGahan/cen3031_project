How to get main.py working on your machine: 
1. Head over to: https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/
2. In the PyCharm environemt: Alt+F12 and then run the command "pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir". If you have a different IDE then the installation should be similar as long as you can access the terminal within it, I just use PyCharm. 
3. You should now be able to access the yfinance library by putting the following command at the top of your file: "import yfinance as yf"
